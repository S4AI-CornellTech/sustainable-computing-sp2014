# ECE 6960: Sustainable Computing (Spring 2024)

## Description

This graduate level course provides an overview of the holistic environmental
impact of computing platforms over the course of their lifetime. Topics include
life cycle analyses of computing devices, carbon footprint of computing,
computer architecture and systems, renewable energy driven data centers,
intermittent computing, sustainable applications (e.g., AI), and emerging
technologies. We will understand how to evaluate and consider the holistic
environmental impact of computing platforms including carbon, water, e-waste,
and materials used. Through reading, analyzing, and discussing papers, and an
open-ended project students will develop a holistic understanding of the
environmental impact of computing and designing sustainable platforms.
